How Many Victims Can We Count?

In a server in Discord there resides a user named Fallen who jumps from Dominant to Dominant like a junkie looking for their next high. 

First we have Wolfie (7/23/25)

Next we have Danie and Synn (8/11/25-8/12/25)

Now Bear (Buck) (8/16/25 & 8/24/25)
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a93e0ef-5599-40f9-b830-af13a33f7a4f

There was another Dominant who had gotten Bear kicked to to the curb (I believe they went by Q?) and has since been passed over for yet ANOTHER Dominant.

Now we are on to Chiefy... They've stumbled across this repository and have since dropped Fallen like a hot potato after reviewing the evidence.

There is also the submissive Jacob panting after her....

Fallen needs to be stopped. Now. Immediately. Before more people get hurt. This list does NOT include the ones who turned her down. To be honest Jacob is closer to 9 or 10 than the 7 that this list makes them look like.

I hate to call these people out, or blast their details here, and I won't say how I acquired the information off of HailDread since even SHE isn't aware that I've gotten it. What I WILL say is that despite even HER best efforts with the VPNs (yes, multiple), and the secured network frame, and the hardened ports, I was able to get what I needed (thank you Discord).
